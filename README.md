`DistCache` is a Distributed Read-Through Cache Engine built in [Go](https://go.dev/).

A Distributed Read-Through Cache is a caching strategy where cache sits between the application and the data source,
automatically fetching and storing data when requested. If data is not in the cache (cache miss), it retrieves it from the primary data source (e.g., database, API), stores it
in the cache, and serves it to the client. This approach reduces direct database queries, improves response times, and enhances system scalability.

`DistCache` was built to be scalable and high available. With `DistCache`, you can instantly create a fast, scalable, distributed system across a cluster of computers.

`DistCache` caching engine is powered by the battle-tested [group cache](https://github.com/groupcache/groupcache-go).

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Features

- **Automatic Fetching**: Data is loaded into the cache on a cache miss.
- **Distributed Architecture**: The cache is spread across multiple nodes for scalability and availability.
- **Reduced Load on Backend**: Frequent reads are served from the cache, minimizing database hits.
- **Configurable Expiry & Eviction**: Data can be automatically expired or evicted based on policies (TTL, LRU, etc.).
- **Automatic Nodes discovery**: All nodes in the cluster are aware of the cluster topology change and react to it
  accordingly.
- **Discovery Provider API**: The developer can build custom nodes discovery providers or use the built-in providers.
- **Built-in Discovery Providers**:
    - [kubernetes](./discovery/kubernetes/README.md) - helps discover cluster nodes during boostrap using the kubernetes client.
    - [NATS](./discovery/nats/README.md) - helps discover cluster nodes during bootstrap using [NATS](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go).
    - [Static](./discovery/static/README.md) - the provided static cluster nodes help form a cluster. This provider is recommended for tests or demo purpose.
    - [DNS](./discovery/dnssd/README.md) - helps discover cluster nodes during bootstrap using the Go's DNS resolver.
- **TLS Support**: `DistCache` comes bundled with TLS support. All nodes must share the same root Certificate Authority (CA) to ensure a successful handshake.
  TLS can be enabled in the [config](./config.go) with the option `WithTLS` method. This method allows you to configure both the TLS server and client settings.
  The TLS configuration is essential for enabling secure communication between nodes.

## üìù How It Works

1. Cache Lookup: The application requests data from the cache.
2. Cache Hit (Data Exists): The cache returns the requested data.
3. Cache Miss (Data Absent):
    - The cache fetches the data from the primary data source.
    - The data is stored in the cache for future requests.
    - The requested data is returned to the client.
4. Subsequent Requests: Future requests for the same data are served from the cache until the data expires or is
   evicted.

## üí° Use Cases

- **High-Traffic Applications** ‚Äì Reduce load on databases (e.g., e-commerce, social media).
- **API Caching** ‚Äì Store API responses to avoid redundant network calls.
- **Session Storage** ‚Äì Maintain fast access to user sessions in distributed systems.

## üíª Installation

```bash
go get github.com/tochemey/distcache
```

## üöÄ Get Started

To integrate `DistCache` into your project, one only need to implement `two key interfaces` that are needed in the [Config](./config.go) to start the `DistCache` [Engine](./engine.go).

### DataSource

The [DataSource](./datasource.go) interface tells `DistCache` where to fetch data from when a cache miss occurs. This could be any external source such as a database, an API, or even a file system.

````go
// DataSource defines the interface used by `distcache` to retrieve data
// when a requested entry is not found in the cache. Implementations of this
// interface provide a mechanism to fetch data from an external source, such
// as a database, API, or file system.
type DataSource interface {
    // Fetch retrieves the value associated with the given key from the data source.
    // It is called when a cache miss occurs.
    //
    // Parameters:
    //   - ctx: A context for managing timeouts, cancellations, or deadlines.
    //   - key: The cache key whose value needs to be fetched.
    //
    // Returns:
    //   - A byte slice containing the fetched data.
    //   - An error if the data retrieval fails.
    Fetch(ctx context.Context, key string) ([]byte, error)
}
````

### KeySpace

The [KeySpace](./keyspace.go) interface defines a `logical namespace for grouping` key/value pairs. It provides metadata such as the namespace's name, storage limits, and expiration logic for keys.
KeySpaces are loaded during `DistCache` bootstrap. 

```go
// KeySpace defines a logical namespace for storing key-value pairs in a distributed cache.
// It provides metadata about the namespace, including its name, storage limits, and data source.
// Additionally, it allows checking when a specific key is set to expire.
type KeySpace interface {
	// Name returns the name of the namespace.
	// The namespace is used to logically group key-value pairs.
	Name() string

	// MaxBytes returns the maximum number of bytes allocated for this namespace.
	// Once the limit is reached, the cache may evict entries based on its eviction policy.
	MaxBytes() int64

	// DataSource returns the underlying data source for this namespace.
	// This source is used to fetch data in case of a cache miss.
	DataSource() DataSource

	// ExpiresAt returns the expiration time for a given key within the namespace.
	// If the key does not have a predefined expiration time, it may return a zero time.
	//
	// ctx: Context for managing timeouts or cancellations.
	// key: The cache key whose expiration time is being queried.
	ExpiresAt(ctx context.Context, key string) time.Time
}
```
